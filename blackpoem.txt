Not so sinister Poem 

The sky is black
the flowers are black
my soul is black
My dog is black

My pony is black
My usb is black
Densel Washington is black
The universe is obscure

But the dragons, with his fire
Can give some brightness to all the universe

But the rainbow is still full of colors
Dejo de llover y desaparecio el arcoiris
